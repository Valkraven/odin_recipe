<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This ravioli recipe includes a homemade pesto-Alfredo sauce and marinara. I wanted to recreate the ravioli dish that you get at Maggiano's Italian restaurant and it turned out great! Don't be intimidated by the large list of ingredients, it is well worth it.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>For the dough:</b> All-purpose flour, salt, eggs, water, and olive oil</li>
    <li><b>For the filling:</b> Ricotta, cream cheese, mozzarella and provolone cheeses, an egg, and dried parsley</li>
    <li><b>For the sauce:</b> Olive oil, garlic, prepared basil pesto sauce (you can use store-bought or homemade sauce), heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, and a jar of marinara sauce</li>
    <li><b>For the egg wash:</b> An egg and water</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<p>Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this easy ravioli from scratch: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Make the dough: Make and knead the dough, then form it into a ball. Tightly wrap the ball and refrigerate for an hour.</li>
    <li>Make the filling: Mix the filling ingredients together and set aside.</li>
    <li>Make the sauce: Cook the garlic and pesto in oil, stir in the heavy cream, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, then whisk in the Parmesan.</li>
    <li>Assemble the ravioli: Roll out the dough into sheets and brush an egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop cheese filling onto the dough about an inch apart. Cover with the top sheet of pasta and make a seal around each portion of filling. Cut out individual ravioli, then seal the edges.</li>
    <li>Cook and bake the ravioli: Boil the ravioli in salted water until the dumplings rise to the top and the filling is hot. Drain well. Bake the ravioli on a greased baking sheet until brown.</li>
    <li>Serve the ravioli: Divide the ravioli between bowls, top with the warmed marinara sauce, then finish with the sauce.</li>
